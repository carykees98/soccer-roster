UI

	- The menus are put together so that each action corresponds to a specific number. In order to use the menu
	  a number must be given, a character will result in an error message for being outside the range of options.
	- Each menu clears the screen in order to make the terminal less cluttered. It does so by printing out an escape
	  sequence which clears the current buffer of all text.

Output File Formats:

	- Save Between Sessions

		- Data saved includes the current season year, number of players in the league, players first name,
		  last name, birth year, and payment status
		- The payment status is stored as a 1 or 0 since the underlying storage method is a boolean
		- The names are stored on separate lines since std::getline is used to get them from the file
		- The first line of the file contains the year and the number of players in the league
